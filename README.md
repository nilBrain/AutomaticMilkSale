![For Farming Simulator 22](https://img.shields.io/badge/Farming%20Simulator-22-10BEFF.svg) [![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/nilbrain/AutomaticMilkSale.svg)]

'Automatic Milk Sail' is a global script mod for Farming Simulator 22.
While this mod is active, the milk from cowsheds and pastures is automatically sold at night at 6 o'clock.

The final selling price per liter is calculated from the base price, the difficulty and a seasonal price fluctuation.
